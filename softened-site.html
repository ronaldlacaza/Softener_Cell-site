                    <p>Here's a spot you could stick some side content relevant to the page you're on. There's also a special link class for anything you decide to put here:</p>

                    <h2>THREETREE</h2>
                    <h2>FULLAHEAD</h2>
                    <p>Tried for an open and soft design on this one. You can see the similarities in this design proposal I did last month.</p>

                    <p><span>A</span> tableless <a href="XHTML">XHTML</a>/<a href="CSS">CSS</a> template that focuses on customization. After the success of my last template reflection, I decided to stick with the "easy-to-modify" theme. The header is simple to change for one of your own, as is the accent colour.</p>
                    <p class="change">To change the accent colour, search the style sheet for <a href="hex">hex</a> value<a href="">#56B600</a> and replace it with one of your own. The top header image is added by the # header class definition.</p>
                    <h2>SEMANTICALLY CODED</h2>
                    <p>This template is coded using the <a href="markup">markup</a> as it was intended. The result is code that is simple to understand and widely supported in different browsers. Another benefit is that <a href="user_agents">user agents</a> that don't support CSS will still display the site's content coherently. You can test it yourself by disabling CSS in your browser.</p>

                    <h2>2005.08.20</h2>
                    <p>Played in the Tree-oh discgolf tournament. Went pretty well, but the body is not happy about the 8 hours of play..</p>
